# Compact Claustrophobia - Open Computers
I created these programs while playing through the `Compact Claustrophobia` `minecraft` modpack on `FTB`.  
I hope you find them useful; they helped me a lot. **:)**

## P.S.
**Make sure you read the comments and place blocks in the correct slots!**
**Sometimes the bot can't pick up the items and they expire on the floor. Check in often!**
